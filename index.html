                    My favourite time spanding activity is playing games and watching films.
                <ul>
                    My favourite films are: 
                <div class = "avengers">
                    <h5><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_avengers"> <b>"Avengers: Endgame"</b></a></h5>
                    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WsPLUYWLL.jpg">
                    <p>Avengers: Endgame is arguably one of the most significant cinematic events of the last decade, and it profoundly affected me, eliciting incredibly strong emotions. The film was more than just a superhero movie; it was a culmination of 22 interconnected films and over a decade of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
                    Avengers: Endgame was a masterful emotional rollercoaster that perfectly balanced despair, hope, excitement, and loss, making it a profoundly moving and unforgettable viewing experience.</p>

                <div class="future">
                    <h5><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/?ref_=chttp_t_30"><b>"Back tp the Future"</b></a></h5>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Back_to_the_Future.jpg">
                    <p>Back to the Future is a masterpiece of adventure, comedy, and science fiction. While it may not hit the deep, tragic notes of an epic finale like Endgame, its impact is rooted in pure exhilaration, nostalgia, and a universally relatable anxiety about identity and time.
                    Ultimately, the film leaves the audience with a persistent feeling of wonder and hope. It makes the fantastic concept of time travel seem tangible and fun, leaving a lasting impression of optimistic curiosity about what the past holds and what the future might bring.</p>

                    <h5><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/?ref_=chttp_t_47"><b> "The Intouchables" </b> </a> </h5>
                    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDA3MDQwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU4Mzc1Nw@@._V1_.jpg">
                    <p>Intouchables is a powerful and deeply moving French film that evokes a complex and rich set of emotions, largely centered on its themes of unlikely friendship, class differences, and the triumph of the human spirit over physical adversity.
                    The film's strongest emotional core is the unexpected, beautiful friendship that develops between Philippe, a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic, and Driss, a street-smart young man from the housing projects hired as his live-in caretaker.
                    While the film is optimistic, it doesn't shy away from the challenges faced by both men, which elicits strong empathetic emotions.
                    In essence, The Intouchables takes you on a journey from pity and loneliness to unbridled joy and inspiration, making it one of the most emotionally impactful films about the human spirit.</p>
